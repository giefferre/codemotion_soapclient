A SOAP client example in Go
===========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/giefferre/codemotion_soapclient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/giefferre/codemotion_soapclient)

This software is a SOAP client for the [GetGeoIp WSDL service](http://www.webservicex.net/geoipservice.asmx), which allows you to get the geographic information of a specific IP.

This code has been shown on April 11th 2014 at [Codemotion Roma 2014](http://rome.codemotionworld.com/2014/) during the first [GOLANGIT Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/golangit/).
